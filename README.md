# ElasticSIEM Project: Monitoring and Detecting Security Events

üöÄ **Project Goal:**  
This project demonstrates how I used **ElasticSIEM** to detect and log specific security events from a Windows virtual machine (VM) using the **Elastic Agent**. By configuring integrations, custom rules, and triggering security events, I show my ability to use SIEM tools to monitor and manage security logs efficiently.

## üéØ **Project Overview**
In this project, I configured a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment using **ElasticSIEM** to monitor security events on a Windows VM. I achieved this by deploying an Elastic Agent, creating custom integration policies, setting up a detection rule, and successfully logging and analyzing triggered security events.

This project highlights my skills in:
- **SIEM implementation** for threat detection and incident response.
- **Monitoring security events** through custom rules.
- **Handling event escalation** as a part of security operations.

## üõ† **Technologies Used**
- **ElasticSIEM**: Security Information and Event Management tool.
- **Elastic Agent**: Lightweight agent to collect security logs from the host.
- **Windows 10 VM**: Host for testing and triggering security events.
- **PowerShell**: Used to simulate security incidents.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup Steps**

### 1. **ElasticSIEM Account Creation**
I created an ElasticSIEM account and accessed the dashboard for monitoring events.

### 2. **Adding Elastic Agent to the Windows Host**
The Elastic Agent was installed on a Windows virtual machine to enable real-time log collection and threat detection.

### 3. **Configuring Integration and Security Policies**
- Added the `ElasticDefendAgent` integration for monitoring Windows events.
- Set up two integration policies: one for system events and one for Windows-specific security events.

### 4. **Creating a Custom Detection Rule**
A new rule called `Test Rule 2` was created to detect specific security incidents, including firewall changes or unauthorized script execution.

### 5. **Triggering Security Events**
A PowerShell command was executed on the Windows VM to simulate a security event (`Set-NetFirewallProfile -All -Enabled True`).

## üìä **Results & Analysis**

### üö® **Triggering Events and Logs**
Once the PowerShell command was executed, the rule (`Test Rule 2`) successfully detected the firewall change and logged the event as `event.code : "4104"`. This was visible in the ElasticSIEM summary, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SIEM setup.

### üîç **Event Investigation and Escalation**
In a real-world scenario, an analyst would escalate this event for further investigation, ensuring it wasn‚Äôt part of an unauthorized breach attempt. Using the **Trends Tab**, we can analyze the frequency of similar events and escalate them as necessary.

## üéâ **Conclusion**
This project showcases my ability to set up and manage **ElasticSIEM** for detecting and analyzing security incidents. By monitoring real-time events on a Windows host, creating custom rules, and simulating security threats, I‚Äôve demonstrated my expertise in:
- **SIEM implementation** and configuration.
- **Log monitoring** and detection of security anomalies.
- **Real-world incident response** techniques.
